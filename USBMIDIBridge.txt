 *  \section Sec_Description Project Description:
 *
 *  USB-MIDI Adapter Peripheral Project. This project implements a bi-directional
 *  link between a host computer and a peripheral MIDI controller over USB. The
 *  project is intended to replace a commercial USB-MIDI adapter and provide direct
 *  communication via two Serial USART ports, minimizing the amount of required
 *  external hardware. A target hardware board should break out both of these pins
 *  as well as power and ground lines, allowing for a controller to connect to a
 *  computer using only one USB cable.
