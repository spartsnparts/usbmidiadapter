To build this firmware, copy the entire directory into the Projects subfolder
in you LUFA build directory. This firmware was written for and built against
version 120730 of the LUFA library.

The USB processing portion of the code should be fairly universal. The portion
of the code responsible for handling serial communication between the adapter
and a controller is specific to the ATMega8/16u2 line of microcontrollers. It
should be fairly easy to adapt for different chips however, simply consult
the datasheet for whatever chip you want to use and substitute the appropriate
registers.
